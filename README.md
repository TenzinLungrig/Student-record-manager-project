# Student-record-manager-project
This project is a simple menu-driven Student Record Management System built using Python. It allows users to add, view, search, and sort student records efficiently. The project was developed as part of my Summer Training on Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.

The program uses Python’s built-in lists and dictionaries to store student data and implements basic algorithms like Linear Search and Bubble Sort to manage and organize the records. It demonstrates how fundamental DSA concepts can be applied in real-world problem-solving.

Features:

  Add new student records (name, roll number, marks)
  
  Display all stored records
  
  Search for a student by roll number
  
  Sort students by marks using Bubble Sort
  
  Simple and user-friendly menu interface

Technologies Used:

  Python 3
  
  Data Structures: List, Dictionary
  
  Algorithms: Linear Search, Bubble Sort

This project is ideal for beginners and showcases how DSA concepts can be implemented in a practical, easy-to-understand way.
